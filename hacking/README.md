# Hacking Scripts

Core hacking automation: hack / grow / weaken loops and orchestrators.

These scripts handle:
- Selecting target servers
- Balancing hack / grow / weaken ratios
- Maximixing income will maintaing security
- Scaling across purchased servers

NB: These scripts actively spend money and use RAM. 

## Standard Use

- Early Game: single target loops
- Mid Game: multi-serve orchestation
- Late Game: batch-style optimization

Most scripts expect the following: 
- Root access on targets
- Sufficient RAM
- A running 'weaken' baseline

NB: Read script headers before running.
