# Hacknet Automation

Scripts for automating Hacknet nodes:
- Purchasing nodes
- Upgrade optimization
- Cost / ROI balancing

NB: These scripts spending money **aggressively.**

## Recommendations

- Do not run blindly in early game
- Always set spending caps if available
- Watch logs the first time you run them

Hacknet is a trap if mismanaged. These scripts *try* to make it a "tool."
